# dexhandv2_cpp_client
DexHand V2 C++ Client Library and Demonstration Client


## Dependencies

### Linux Only

This library currently is only scoped to build and run on linux systems. We test on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS. 
If you'd like to take a stab at getting it to compile for other platforms, we would welcome those PR's
as it would be great to have it running on Windows, and MacOS as well.

### Packages

__libudev__ - Required for USB communications
